# HomeSage Power Management System

The purpose of the HomeSage Power Management System is to give a homeowner a simple way to become mindful of the power that they use, as well as a way to reduce their power consumption. The system uses Hall effect sensors to measure the amount of current being drawn by a connected load. A voltage measurement circuit measures the voltage of the line input. The measurements are converted to digital values, and the power is calculated by a microprocessor. The power is displayed on an LCD and is sent to a user interface located on a Linux computer. Solid State relays are used to allow switching of the 120V outputs, to which loads may be connected. The system has been designed to measured voltage and current to 5% accuracy and measure power to 10% accuracy, although the accuracy of the system has proven to be much greater.
